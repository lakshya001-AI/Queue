# Java Queue Implementation

This is a simple Java implementation of a queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations. Queues are a fundamental data structure in computer science, commonly used to manage elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.

## Introduction

This Java Queue implementation provides a basic framework for managing a queue of elements. It includes two primary operations:

1. `enqueue`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. `dequeue`: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.

The implementation uses a linked list as the underlying data structure to efficiently support both enqueue and dequeue operations.

## Usage

To use this Queue implementation in your Java project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-queue.git
   ```

2. Import the `Queue` class into your Java project:

   ```java
   import java.util.Queue;
   ```

3. Create a `Queue` object:

   ```java
   Queue<String> myQueue = new Queue<>();
   ```

4. Use the `enqueue` method to add elements to the queue:

   ```java
   myQueue.enqueue("Item 1");
   myQueue.enqueue("Item 2");
   ```

5. Use the `dequeue` method to remove and retrieve elements from the queue:

   ```java
   String item = myQueue.dequeue();
   ```

6. Enjoy using the queue in your application!

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use this Java Queue implementation:

```java
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<String> myQueue = new Queue<>();

        // Enqueue some items
        myQueue.enqueue("Apple");
        myQueue.enqueue("Banana");
        myQueue.enqueue("Cherry");

        // Dequeue items and print them
        System.out.println("Dequeuing items:");
        while (!myQueue.isEmpty()) {
            String item = myQueue.dequeue();
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }
}
```
